## 🔍 Implemented Models

Each model below is accompanied by:
- **Easy-to-follow code**
- **Interactive visualizations**
- **Evaluation metrics and insights**

### 🌲 Decision Tree
A powerful model for **classification and regression** tasks, with easy-to-interpret results due to its tree-like structure. Check out the code to see it applied to decision-making processes in data.

### 📊 KMeans Clustering
Discover how to segment data into clusters based on feature similarity. This **unsupervised learning** model is perfect for understanding patterns in unlabelled data.

### 👥 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Explore how KNN predicts the label of a point by looking at its neighbors, ideal for **simple classification tasks** and learning about distance-based models.

### 📈 Linear Regression
Learn about one of the most popular **regression models** that finds a linear relationship between dependent and independent variables. Perfect for predictive tasks.

### 🔻 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA reduces high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional form for easy visualization and improved computational efficiency.
